Overview
========

This wiki provides a guide for the users of the MRC Epidemiology Secure
Research Computing Platform (SRCP).

SRCP is a platform provided by the University of Cambridge `Research
Computing Service <https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/srcp/index.html>`__. It
allows researchers to access valuable datasets for research, similar to
a secure reference library. Rather than extracts of individual level
data being ‘released,’ SRCP provides access to a secure analytics
environment so researchers bring analysis to the data. Results are
vetted before being removed from the platform.

SRCP has standard analysis software such as R and Python available,
along with tools for more specialist ’omics analyses. There is scope to
add new software that is not currently available, which is assessed on a
case by case basis.

SRCP has some similarities to the Cambridge Service for Data Driven
Discovery (CSD3) system (also known as the High Performance Computer or
HPC) and therefore it can be helpful to refer to the
`documentation <https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/index.html>`__ for this
system too.
