Taking files on and off the SRCP
================================

Explanation of file transfers on the SRCP
-----------------------------------------

The SRCP Platform enforces strict controls and comprehensive auditing of all file uploads and downloads to ensure the appropriate use of participant data and the protection of participant identities.  Users cannot access their project folder from outside the SRCP. This prevents data from being removed from or brought onto the system without permission.

All data analysis and processing should be performed within the SRCP environment. Only summary-level (aggregate) data are eligible for export; individual-level data cannot be exported under any circumstances. Our policy is to minimise the amount of data that is taken off the SRCP — request only the minimum data necessary for your research. 

Before any file is released from the system, it is checked by a Data Manager to ensure that it meets the **Disclosure Control Rules**:

-  minimise the number of items to be checked, perhaps by only removing final results for publication. Requests to export large numbers of items will need to be revised to something more manageable.
-  provide a description of what the file contains, how it was generated
   and its relevance to the research question
-  files should only contain aggregated, summary results, not individual values
-  results are clearly labelled
-  files should not have any participant or sample IDs
-  mask phenotype counts lower than 10 (e.g. if the results show 3 people have lung cancer, this should be masked)

To maintain the security and integrity of the SRCP platform, it is essential to review all files before they are introduced into the system. This helps protect participant data, ensures compliance with research policies, and prevents the introduction of malicious software. Before any file is brought onto the system, it is checked by a Data Manager to ensure that:

- Additional data brought onto the system should be approved for use on the research question if it is not publicly available
- Code that is being brought in is relevant to the research question and sourced from a reputable location so that it does not contain malware

Within the SRCP, each user is assigned a personal triage area that is accessible via SFTP from outside the platform. Users can upload files to and download files from this triage area, but cannot move files directly between their triage area and project folder. Only a Data Manager is authorised to transfer files between a user’s triage area and their project folder, following a thorough review. Users must inform a Data Manager when files are ready for inspection. Once approved and transferred, the files become immediately available to the user.

Process for downloading files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A user wishes to download some results from the SRCP
2. They `notify a Data Manager <https://mrc-epid-dmt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6>`__ of the file name, location (e.g. their project folder) and a statement of how it meets the Disclosure Control Rules (see above)
3. The Data Manager inspects the file and confirms that it contains results, not any individual level data
4. The Data Manager copies the file from the user’s project folder to their “download” triage folder and notifies the user
5. The user connects to their “download” triage folder using SFTP and downloads the file

Process for uploading files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A user wishes to upload some supplementary data or code to the SRCP
2. The user connects to their “upload” triage folder using SFTP and uploads the file
3. They `notify a Data Manager <https://mrc-epid-dmt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6>`__  of the file name, location (their “upload” triage folder) and a statement that permission has been granted for the data to be used in this research (data) or that the code is from a reputable source (code). Describe why the items are needed for the research.
4. The Data Manager inspects the file and confirms that it contains appropriate data/code
5. The Data Manager copies the file from the user’s “upload” triage folder to the user’s project folder and notifies the user
6. The user uses the file that is now available in their project folder

.. _SFTP-client:
Connecting to epi-analysis SRCP with SFTP
-----------------------------------------

The **address** of the epi-analysis SFTP site is ``data-epi-analysis.srcp.hpc.cam.ac.uk``.

The **username**, **password** and **2 factor authentication device** are the same as those used to log into the web interface.

SFTP Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect, an `SFTP client <https://www.sftp.net/clients>`__ is required such as:

-  `FileZilla <https://filezilla-project.org>`__
-  `WinSCP <https://winscp.net>`__
-  `CyberDuck <https://cyberduck.io>`__
-  `rsync <https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync>`__
-  `sftp <https://linux.die.net/man/1/sftp>`__

.. note::
   When setting up the Client, check that the host key matches ``SHA256:adCe50mCH97ui49A9zEpq1uitolpLoCGawLMnLTBPOk``. If your client ever warns that the host key has changed, and it does not match this key then do not proceed and contact srcpdata@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk

Example of setting up WinSCP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect to the Cambridge VPN (or use a computer that is connected to the Cambridge Network)

2. Start WinSCP where you will be presented with the Login dialogue

  :alt: WinSCP login page

3. Choose SFTP as the protocol, enter the hostname as **data-epi-analysis.srcp.hpc.cam.ac.uk**, set the port to 22 and enter your CRSid as the username (i.e. the same username you use to log into the SRCP web interface).

4. Click Save and then click OK to save the session as a site. This will allow you to reconnected more easily in the future.

5. You will see a warning about the server key not being found in the cache:

.. figure:: ../../images/unknown-server.png

  :alt: Unknown server

Check that the key is ``SHA-256:  adCe50mCH97ui49A9zEpq1uitolpLoCGawLMnLTBPOk``. If it is not, then click Cancel and contact srcpdata@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk

.. _SFTP-upload:
Example of uploading files using WinSCP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect to the Cambridge VPN  (or use a computer that is connected to the Cambridge Network)

2. Start WinSCP where you will be presented with the Login dialogue. Select the session for the SRCP that you saved previously

.. figure:: ../../images/winscp-prev-login.png

3. Click the Login button.

4. Enter your CRS/Raven password (the same as for the SRCP web interface) and then enter a TOTP from your mobile device for 2 factor authentication (the same as for the SRCP web interface)

7. `Notify a Data Manager <https://mrc-epid-dmt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6>`__  and let them know that you need files copies from your “upload” folder to your project folder. They will check the files, copy them to your project folder if all is OK and notify you that the files are available or advise what changes are needed.

.. _SFTP-download:
Example of downloading files using WinSCP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. **TO DO - make sure permissions are set so that DM can read the
   file**

1. `Notify a Data Manager <https://mrc-epid-dmt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6>`__  and let them know that you need files copied from your project folder to your “download” folder. Provide a statement of how the files meet the Disclosure Control Rules (see above). They will check the files, copy them to your download folder if all is OK and notify you that they are available for download or advise what changes are needed.
